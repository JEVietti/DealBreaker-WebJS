# DealBreaker-WebJS
Dealbreaker Dating Web App using MEAN and MERN stacks.

Each person lists their qualities and attributes for the each potential match but only their bad attributes and deal breakers are visible until being confirmed. This lets the user know what they are in for with the added suspense of discovering their matches best attributes, however a short biography is included to give each user's profile a personality.

Users are able to give Feedback on each other by commenting on the user's profile available for other potential matches to see. This is not a forum for bullying, rather to weed out malicious profiles that are not using the website seriously.

 Dealbreaker is a free and open source dating website, which will be supported by the user's choice to donate using PayPal!
